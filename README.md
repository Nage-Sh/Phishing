# Phishing Email Identification
 
This is my second day task of my cybersecurity internship 
Today I have completed the task of identifying the email phishing

> I did on taking some datasets from the datasets folder
>
> Understood the pattern template of the email
>
 * It looks like from the genuine authorised company
 * Creates a sense of urgency
 * Unbelivable claims and activities
> 
> Have dubious links to catch the emails and passwords of the victims

The datasets I took from the [CanIPhish](https://caniphish.com/email-phishing-simulator?email=Dropbox-Verify-Login#emailTitle)
>It had around 42 templates I only shared here 3 datasets

Thank you :)
